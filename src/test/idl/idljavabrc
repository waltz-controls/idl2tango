# IDL Java bridge configuration (Windows)

##########################
# Java CLASSPATH setting
##########################
#
#
#    This setting determines how the IDL-Java bridge finds its java classes.
#    It MUST be set in the config file if you wish to find any classes other
#    than those provided by Java
#
#    If $CLASSPATH appears in the setting (as shown below), the value of
#    the environment variable $CLASSPATH is substituted in this setting
#
#    Entries in Classpath should be seperated by a semi-colon on Windows
#
#    NOTE: This setting follows the rules of the -classpath option in the java
#          or javac command,  That is, .jar files should be explicitly stated.
#          If only a directory location is specified, Java will find .class
#          files inside this folder but NOT .jar files


# Allow IDL-Java bridge to use .class files located in my CLASSPATH and also the
# classes found in the examples .jar file shipped with the bridge

JVM Classpath = $CLASSPATH;D:\Projects\hzg.wpn.projects\idl2tango\target\IDL2TangoJavaClient-1.0.5.jar



################################
# Java virtual machine locations
################################
#
#    When running the IDL-Java bridge from the IDL Workbench, the
#    Java Virtual Machine used by the workbench is also used for the
#    bridge. Values set in this file or by the IDLJAVAB_LIB_LOCATION
#    environment variable are ignored.
#
#    A 1.6 or later JVM is required.
#
#    For IDL command line and runtime sessions, these settings control
#    which Java Virtual Machine is started by the IDL-Java Bridge.
#    They are initially commented out because the bridge attempts to
#    use existing system knowledge to determine the current JVM.
#    This is determined as follows:
#
#       1. If 'JVM LibLocation' is set in the config file, this JVM is run.
#
#       2. Otherwise, check the environment variable $IDLJAVAB_LIB_LOCATION.
#          It is the secondary method for setting 'JVM LibLocation'.  If set,
#          this JVM is run.
#
#       3. Else, check the environment variable $JAVA_HOME.  This often points
#          to the top of the current Java SDK.  From this setting, the bridge
#          attempts to infer a 'good' JVM to run.  It looks for these JVMs in
#          order:
#          classic, hotspot, client, server.
#
#
#       4. Otherwise, check the JavaSoft registry entries.
#          If 'Java Development Kit' is set, use the JVM in this SDK
#          (assumes hotspot JVM for Java 1.6 and client JVM for 1.6 and later)
#          Otherwise, if 'Java Runtime Environment' is set, use this JVM.
#
#
#    Sample settings in this config file would look like this:
#
#      JVM LibLocation  = C:\jdk1.6\jre\bin\client


#use JAVA_HOME
#JVM LibLocation = C:\Programs\Java\jdk1.8.0_05\bin


###################
# JVM start options
###################
#
#   'JVM Option#'
#      There may be up to 20 additional JVM options specified.  These
#      will be used when starting the JVM.
#
#      NOTE: This is for advanced users only who understand JVM initialization
#
#
#      For example, a user that wants to reset the initial and maximum memory
#      allocated when the JVM starts, might do something like:
#        JVM Option1 = -Xms4m
#        JVM Option2 = -Xmx16m
#
#      NOTE: These options are unsupported options...thus their effects are
#            implementation-dependent. It's possible that your implementation
#            doesn't support them.
#
#      When running the IDL-Java bridge from the IDL Workbench, any
#      JVM options included in this file are ignored. To set JVM
#      options to be used by processes launched by the IDL Workbench,
#      add the option flags to the idlde.ini file for your system.

#JVM Option1 = -Xdebug
#JVM Option2 = -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=5005
#JVM Option1 = -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=5005


###########################
# IDL-Java Bridge debugging
###########################
#
#
# Some limited debugging is provided via a log file.
#
# 'Log Location':  Location where log files will be created.
#                  Log files have format jb_log<pid>.txt
#
# 'Bridge Logging':  Level of debugging information logged to log file.
#                    Possible options are:
#                    - SEVERE (default, bridge errors logged)
#                    - CONFIG (configuration settings logged)
#                    - CONFIGFINE (configuration settings logged, more detail)

Log Location = logs
Bridge Logging = CONFIG


##############################
# IDL-Java Bridge Reset Policy
##############################
#
# By default, the IDL-Java bridge persists for the duration of the IDL
# session in which it was created. This means that modifications to
# items in the Java Classpath are not loaded until a new IDL session
# is started. This policy allows the IDL-Java bridge to be configured
# to reset when the IDL executive command .FULL_RESET_SESSION is executed.
#
# NOTE: when running the IDL-Java bridge from the IDL Workbench, the
# value of the 'Restart Bridge' setting is ignored. Restart the IDL
# Workbench to restart the IDL-Java bridge.
#
# 'Restart Bridge':  Policy for restarting the IDL-Java bridge.
#                    Possible options are:
#                    - False (Bridge does not reset during an IDL session)
#                    - True  (Bridge resets when the .FULL_RESET_SESSION
#                             executive command is executed)

#Restart Bridge = True
